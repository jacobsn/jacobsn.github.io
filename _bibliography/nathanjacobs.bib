@article{geofacial,
	Abstract = {While face analysis from images is a well-studied area,
    little work has explored the dependence of facial appearance on
      the geographic location from which the image was captured. To
      fill this gap, we constructed GeoFaces, a large dataset of
      geotagged face images, and used it to examine the geo-dependence
  of facial features and attributes, such as ethnicity, gender, or the
  presence of facial hair. Our analysis illuminates the relationship
  between raw facial appearance, facial attributes, and geographic
  location, both globally and in selected major urban areas. Some of
  our experiments, and the resulting visualizations, confirm prior
  expectations, such as the predominance of ethnically Asian faces in
  Asia, while others highlight novel information that can be obtained
  with this type of analysis, such as the major city with the highest
  percentage of people with a mustache.},

  abstract   = {Global satellite imagery provides nearly ubiquitous views
    of the Earth's surface, and the tens of thousands of webcams
      provide live views from near Earth viewpoints. Combining these
      into a single application creates live views in the global
      context, where cars move through intersections, trees sway in
      the wind, and students walk across campus in real-time. This
      integration of the camera requires registration, which takes
      time, effort, and expertise. Here we report on two participatory
      interfaces that simplify this registration by providing
      applications which allow anyone to use live webcam streams to
      create virtual overhead views or to map live texture onto 3D
      models. We highlight system design issues that affect the
      scalability of such a service, and offer a case-study of how we
      overcame these in building a system which is publicly available
      and integrated with Google Maps and the Google Earth Plug-in.
      Imagery registered to features in GIS applications can be
      considered as richly geotagged, and we discuss opportunities for
      this rich geotagging.},

    sensors that have different design constraints than standard
      cameras.  Surprisingly, little work has explored the
      relationship between compressive-sensing measurements and
      differential image motion.  We show that, given modest
      constraints on the measurements and image motions, we can omit
      the computationally expensive compressive-sensing reconstruction
      step and obtain more accurate motion estimates with
      significantly less computation time. We also formulate a
      compressive-sensing reconstruction problem that incorporates
      known image motion and show that this method outperforms the
      state-of-the-art in compressive-sensing video reconstruction.},

      capture the 3D structure of outdoor scenes observed over time
      from a static camera.  We derive two cues that relate 3D
      distances to changes in pixel intensity due to clouds shadows.
      The first cue is primarily spatial, works with low frame-rate
      time lapses, and supports estimating focal length and scene
      structure, up to a scale ambiguity.  The second cue depends on
      cloud motion and has a more complex, but still linear,
    ambiguity.  We describe a method that uses the spatial cue to
      estimate a depth map and a method that combines both cues.
      Results on time lapses of several outdoor scenes show that these
      cues enable estimating scene geometry and camera focal length.},

    images freely over the Internet.  We report on methods for
      discovering and organizing this already existing and massively
      distributed global sensor, and argue that it provides an
      interesting alternative to satellite imagery for global-scale
      remote sensing applications.  In particular, we characterize the
      live imaging capabilities that are freely available as of the
      summer of 2009 in terms of the spatial distribution of the
      cameras, their update rate, and characteristics of the scene in
      view.  We offer algorithms that exploit the fact that webcams
      are typically static to simplify the tasks of inferring relevant
      environmental and weather variables directly from image data.
      Finally, we show that organizing and exploiting the large,
    ad-hoc, set of cameras attached to the web can dramatically
      increase the data available for studying particular problems in
      phenology.},

      discovers and parametrizes the lanes along which vehicles drive,
    then uses just these pixels to simultaneously track dozens of

      function used to parametrize the lanes of travel based only on
      the accumulation of spatio-temporal image derivatives, and a
      tracking algorithm that exploits longer temporal constraints
      made possible by our compact data representation; we believe
      both of these may be of independent interest.  We offer

      based on a standard (but state of the art) probabilistic
      tracking model.  Our contribution is to explicitly detail where
      human annotation of the scene (e.g. ``this is a lane''), a track
      (e.g. ``this track is bad''), or a pair of tracks (e.g. ``these
          two tracks are confused'') can be naturally integrated
      within the probabilistic tracking framework.  For a early
      prototype system, we offer results and examples from a dense

    archived from webcams tend to underplay the challenges in working
      with large data sets acquired from uncontrolled webcams in real
      environments.  In building a database of images captured from
      1000 webcams, every 30 minutes for the last 3 years, we observe
      that these cameras have a wide variety of failure modes.  This
      paper details steps we have taken to make this dataset more
      easily useful to the research community, including (a) tools for
      finding stable temporal segments, and stabilizing images when
      the camera is nearly stable, (b) visualization tools to quickly
      summarize a years worth of image data from one camera and to
      give a set of exemplars that highlight anomalies within the
      scene, and (c) integration with LabelMe, allowing labels of
      static features in one image of a scene to propagate to the
      thousands of other images of that scene.  We also present
      proof-of-concept algorithms showing how this data conditioning

      common approaches to background subtraction and video
      representation are implicitly based on a single temporal scale.
      In this work we derive a set of causal filters which define a
      temporal scale-space representation for the activity at each
      pixel.  This scale-space can be maintained and continuously
      updated in real-time, and, for static cameras viewing dynamic
      scenes, has several interesting properties.  In particular, it
      directly characterizes interesting temporal features and
      supports approximate reconstruction of the video history under
      challenging noise conditions.  The temporal scale-space grounds
      novel approaches to several applications, including a natural
      visualization tool to summarize recent video behavior in a
      single image, and a tool to directly report how long the object
      has been present in a scene without re-examining any video data.},
