  abstract   = {While face analysis from images is a well-studied area,
                little work has explored the dependence of facial appearance on
                the geographic location from which the image was captured. To
                fill this gap, we constructed GeoFaces, a large dataset of
                geotagged face images, and used it to examine the geo-dependence
                of facial features and attributes, such as ethnicity, gender, or the
                presence of facial hair. Our analysis illuminates the relationship
                between raw facial appearance, facial attributes, and geographic
                location, both globally and in selected major urban areas. Some of
                our experiments, and the resulting visualizations, confirm prior
                expectations, such as the predominance of ethnically Asian faces in
                Asia, while others highlight novel information that can be obtained
                with this type of analysis, such as the major city with the highest
                percentage of people with a mustache.},

                of the Earth's surface, and the tens of thousands of webcams
                provide live views from near Earth viewpoints. Combining these
                into a single application creates live views in the global
                context, where cars move through intersections, trees sway in
                the wind, and students walk across campus in real-time. This
                integration of the camera requires registration, which takes
                time, effort, and expertise. Here we report on two participatory
                interfaces that simplify this registration by providing
                applications which allow anyone to use live webcam streams to
                create virtual overhead views or to map live texture onto 3D
                models. We highlight system design issues that affect the
                scalability of such a service, and offer a case-study of how we
                overcame these in building a system which is publicly available
                and integrated with Google Maps and the Google Earth Plug-in.
                Imagery registered to features in GIS applications can be
                considered as richly geotagged, and we discuss opportunities for
                this rich geotagging.},

                step and obtain more accurate motion estimates with
                significantly less computation time. We also formulate a
                compressive-sensing reconstruction problem that incorporates
                known image motion and show that this method outperforms the

                distances to changes in pixel intensity due to clouds shadows.
                The first cue is primarily spatial, works with low frame-rate

                structure, up to a scale ambiguity.  The second cue depends on

                tracking based on explicitly considering the context surrounding

                based on a standard (but state of the art) probabilistic
                tracking model.  Our contribution is to explicitly detail where
                human annotation of the scene (e.g. ``this is a lane''), a track
                (e.g. ``this track is bad''), or a pair of tracks (e.g. ``these
                two tracks are confused'') can be naturally integrated
                within the probabilistic tracking framework.  For a early

                common approaches to background subtraction and video
                representation are implicitly based on a single temporal scale.
                In this work we derive a set of causal filters which define a
                temporal scale-space representation for the activity at each
                pixel.  This scale-space can be maintained and continuously
                updated in real-time, and, for static cameras viewing dynamic
                scenes, has several interesting properties.  In particular, it
                directly characterizes interesting temporal features and
                supports approximate reconstruction of the video history under
                challenging noise conditions.  The temporal scale-space grounds
                novel approaches to several applications, including a natural

  abstract   = {A key problem in widely distributed camera networks is
                geolocating the cameras. This paper considers three scenarios for
                camera localization: localizing a camera in an unknown
                environment, adding a new camera in a region with many other
                cameras, and localizing a camera by finding correlations with
                satellite imagery. We find that simple summary statistics (the
                time course of principal component coefficients) are sufficient
                to geolocate cameras without determining correspondences between
                cameras or explicitly reasoning about weather in the scene. We
                present results from a database of images from 538 cameras
                collected over the course of a year. We find that for cameras
                that remain stationary and for which we have accurate image
                timestamps, we can localize most cameras to within 50 miles of
                the known location. In addition, we demonstrate the use of a
                distributed camera network in the construction a map of weather
                conditions.},

                taken by static cameras. These images have consistent correlations
                over the entire image and over time scales of days
                to months. Simple second-order statistics of such image
                sets show vastly more structure than exists in generic natural
                images or video from moving cameras. Using a slight
                variant to PCA, we can decompose all cameras into comparable
                components and annotate images with respect to
                surface orientation, weather, and seasonal change. Experiments
                are based on a data set from 538 cameras across the
                United States which have collected more than 17 million
                images over the the last 6 months.},

  abstract   = {Detecting, isolating, and tracking moving objects in an
                outdoor scene is a fundamental problem of visual surveillance.  A
                key component of most approaches to this problem is the
                construction of a background model of intensity values. We
                propose extending background modeling to include learning a
                model of the expected shape of foreground objects.  This paper
                describes our approach to shape description, shape space density
                estimation, and unsupervised model training. A key contribution
                is a description of properties of the joint distribution of
                object shape and image location.  We show object segmentation
                and anomalous shape detection results on video captured from
                road intersections. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of
                building scene-specific and spatially-localized shape background
                models.},

                high-dimensional data that vary nonlinearly due to a few parameters.
                Applications to the analysis of medical imagery and human motion
                patterns have been successful despite the lack of effective tools to
                parameterize cyclic data sets. This paper offers an initial approach
                to this problem, and provides for a minimal parameterization of
                points that are drawn from cylindrical manifolds-data whose
                (unknown) generative model includes a cyclic and a non-cyclic
                parameter. Solving for this special case is important for a number
                of current, practical applications and provides a start toward a
                general approach to cyclic manifolds. We offer results on synthetic
                and real data sets and illustrate an application to de-noising
                cardiac ultrasound images.},

  abstract  = {Search engine queries are normally brief but often return
               unmanageably long results, with which users struggle to determine
               document quality and relevance. In recent years, many studies
               have enhanced search results with metadata displayed as visual
               cues. Their success in helping users make faster and more
               accurate document judgments has been uneven, reflecting the wide
               range of information needs and document selection strategies of
               users, and also the relative effectiveness of different
               visualization forms.
               We identify the frequency with which query terms are found in a
               document as a straightforward and effective way for users to see
               the relationship between their query and the search results. In our
               prototype, we display these frequencies using simple pie charts.
               Despite performance limitations, evaluation with 101 users has been
               promising and suggests future developments.},
