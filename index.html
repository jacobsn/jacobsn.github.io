<h2>Research</h2>
<p> I am excited about using computer vision and machine learning techniques to understand the world. I have focused on a variety of problems, including time-lapse understanding, environmental monitoring, remote sensing, medical imaging, and video surveillance. You can learn more by visiting my <a href="https://mvrl.cse.wustl.edu">lab website</a> or checking out my <a href="cv.pdf">CV</a>.</p>

<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Nathan Jacobs earned a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Washington
University in St. Louis (2010). After many years at the University of
Kentucky, he is currently a Professor in the Computer Science &amp; Engineering department at Washington University in St. Louis. Dr. Jacobs' research area is computer vision; his specialty is developing learning-based algorithms and systems for processing large-scale image collections.  His current focus is on developing techniques for mining information about people and the natural world from geotagged imagery, including images from social networks, publicly available outdoor webcams, and satellites.  His research has been funded by NSF, NIH, DARPA, IARPA, NGA, ARL, AFRL, and Google.</p>
