<p>I am a computer vision researcher, but I also work on (deep) machine learning, medical imaging, and remote sensing. I earned a Ph.D. in Computer Science at <a href="http://cse.wustl.edu">Washington University in St. Louis</a>, under the direction of <a href="https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~pless/">Robert Pless</a>. </p>
<p>I have a few different roles at the University of Kentucky:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Associate Professor of <a href="http://cs.uky.edu/">Computer Science</a></li>
  <li>Director of Graduate Studies for <a href="https://www.engr.uky.edu/data-science">Data Science</a></li>
  <li>Director of the <a href="http://mvrl.cs.uky.edu/">Multimodal Vision Research Laboratory</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I am also the owner of <a href="https://www.mvresearch.com/">Multidomain Vision Research</a>.</p>

<h2>Research</h2>
<p> I am excited about using computer vision and machine learning techniques to understand the world. I have focused on a variety of problems, including time-lapse understanding, environmental monitoring, remote sensing, medical imaging, and video surveillance. You can learn more by visiting my <a href="http://mvrl.cs.uky.edu">lab website</a> or checking out my <a href="cv.pdf">CV</a>.</p>
<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Nathan Jacobs earned a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Washington University in St. Louis (2010). Since then, he has been a Professor of Computer Science at the University of Kentucky.  Dr. Jacobs' research area is computer vision; his specialty is developing learning-based algorithms and systems for processing large-scale image collections.  His current focus is on developing techniques for mining information about people and the natural world from geotagged imagery, including images from social networks, publicly available outdoor webcams, and satellites.  His research has been funded by NSF, NIH, DARPA, IARPA, NGA, ARL, AFRL, and Google.</p>
